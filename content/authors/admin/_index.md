Hiya,

I am a first year Canadian medical student in Ontario. A first-generation Canadian, and the first physician of the family. This blog is meant to be a reflective outlet about my MD journey and whatever I find of interest along the way. Like life, it will go through an iterative process, growing and adapting as I develop. 

My hope is that I can look back on this as a reminder of the humour, aspirations, and desire to help that I am starting with in this journey. Although this is a personal blog, I promised myself that I would find opportunities to support others going through the medical school application process. So weaved in between my musings, humble opinions, and scattered spiels will be posts answering the most commonly asked questions I receive. 

Hope you find something of interest/useful during your visit. If you would like me to write about something, reach out!

With many virtual hugs,

Philo
